# Patient Polish Tutor Documentation

All project documentation (overview, progress tracker, specifications, and runbooks) now lives under [`ops/docs/`](ops/docs/).

- Start at [`ops/docs/README.md`](ops/docs/README.md) for the full project overview and setup instructions.
- Additional references: [`ops/docs/PROGRESS.md`](ops/docs/PROGRESS.md), [`ops/docs/ROADMAP.md`](ops/docs/ROADMAP.md), [`ops/docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](ops/docs/SPECIFICATION.md), [`ops/docs/STATUS.json`](ops/docs/STATUS.json), and more inside that folder.

The rest of the repository layout (source, frontend, tests, and ops tooling) reflects the simplified tutoring runtime.
